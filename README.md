# RayTracer

A raytracing project of a 3D scene of objects (planes and spheres), where raytracing is used to render the scene with lights and textures are applied to objects. Shading is implemented using lambert and phong shading. Lights include point lights and area lights, the latter of which creates a soft shadow effect. Textures are applied using a diffuse map and specular map (textures sourced from https://www.sketchuptextureclub.com/).
Coded using C++ and the OpenFrameworks library.
